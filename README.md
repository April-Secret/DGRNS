# DGRNS: A deep learning framework for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data
Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on gene expression profiles is able to provide an insight into a number of cellular phenotypes from the genomic level and reveal the essential laws underlying various life phenomena. Different from the bulk expression data, single-cell tran-scriptomic data embody cell-to-cell variance and diverse biological information, such as tissue characteristics, transformation of cell types, etc. Inferring GRNs based on such data offers unprec-edented advantages for making a profound study of cell phenotypes, revealing gene functions and exploring potential interactions. However, the high sparsity, noise and dropout events of single-cell transcriptomic data pose new challenges for regulation identification.
We develop a deep learning framework for gene regulatory network inference from sin-gle-cell transcriptomic data, DGRNS, which encodes the row data and combines the advantages of RNN and CNN to train a model capable of distinguishing related gene pairs from unrelated gene pairs. To overcome the limitations of such datasets, it applies sliding windows to extract valuable features while preserving the direction of regulation. DGRNS is constructed as a deep learning model containing GRU network for exploring time-dependent information and CNN for learning spatially related information. Our comprehensive and detailed comparative analysis on the dataset of mouse hematopoietic stem cells illustrates that DGRNS outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The networks inferred by DGRNS are about 10% higher than the AUROC of other unsupervised methods, and 8% higher than the AUPR of other supervised methods. By comparing the predic-tions with the standard network, we discover a number of novel interactions which are proved to be true in some specific cell types. Importantly, DGRNS identifies a series of regulatory relationships with high confidence and functional consistency, but they have not yet been experimentally con-firmed and merit further research.
